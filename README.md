# Basic-Programming-Questions
* This repository contains some basic programming questions which are very useful to master the basics of programming of any language but here I have used Java.
* By solving all the basic questions we can build a strong foundation, it is like building a strong foundation for tall building.
* It is important to solve these basic questions because it will improve our logic building skill.
* Try to solve all the questions by yourself by building your own logic, your code dosen't have to be same as mine, But if you ever get stuck in between you can come and refer the code uploaded and learn.
* You can solve these questions with any programming language, while solving these questions more foucs was  on logic building and less focus on learning the language.

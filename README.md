# Basic-Programming-Questions
This repository contains some basic programming questions which are very useful to master the basics of programming of any language but here I have used Java.
By solving all the basic questions we can improve our logic bulding skill and also we will learn logic behind some basic code.
Try to solve all the questions by yourself by building your own logic, your code dosen't have to be same as mine, But if you ever get stuck in between you can 
come and refer the code uploaded and learn.
We can solve these questions with any programming language, while solving these questions more foucs was more on logic building and less focus on learning the language.
